          *UX engineer* typically implies a designer who codesâ€”and that's an accurate description. I built and maintain a UI component library, re-wrote the core CSS architecture, and built a new landing page for the [New Visions Portal](https://portal-test.newvisions.org).

          But more precisely, a UX engineer is someone who applies engineering problem-solving to holistically solve complex interaction problems. The [New Visions dashboard framework](./portfolio/newvisions), and the [Noom food logging workflow](./portfolio/noom) are just two examples of tackling tough problems through analysis and creative problem solving.

          I'm at the intersection of design and engineering, with an education in [Systems Design Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/about-systems-design-engineering/what-systems-design-engineering) and experience in UX since 2013. I approach problems holistically, design complete solutions, and execute them efficiently.
