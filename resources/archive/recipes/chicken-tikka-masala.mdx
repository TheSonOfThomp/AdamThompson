# Chicken Tikka Masala

My take on the classic Indian dish is a synthesis of several online recipes. 
I don't claim that this is _authentic_ per-se, but the best I've been able to make on my own.
My preferred technique is to prepare the chicken separately from the gravy. 
This allows you to focus on the sauce without worrying about over- or under-cooking the chicken.

The recipe describes medium-spice. Remove 1/4 tsp of cayenne for mild, or add cayenne pepper to taste.
